-For foreign players-

To patch v0.21, you only have to merge Ore Custom Conquest Cave v0.2 directory in v0.21 zip file with OCCC's directory in your MountBlade Warband/module/.
v0.21 is (maybe) save data compatible with v0.2fix3.

About OCCC and Cave series:
	Cave-mod was originally made by Mr.K, and later, Cave Difor was made as its successor and has been maintained by Mr.Koduka.
	OCCC is one of cave series mods, derived from Cave Difor initially.
	In OCCC, Many contents are added and thus it's far more complicated than the original one.
	So if you feel OCCC is bit messy, I suggest you to try Cave Difor.
	The original cave-mod is sadly outdated now, still as I mentioned, Cave Difor has been maintained well. It's classic and neat.

If you feel confused upon playing the series, these articles might help you (they are written in Japanese, so you need to use google translator though):

Thank you for playing Cave mod series, and sorry for my awkward English. Enjoy!
